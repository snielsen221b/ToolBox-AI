Cost:
g_cost -> how many moves it takes to get from the start to that tile
h_cost -> distance from tile to the cake
f_cost -> the sum of the g_cost and the h_cost


diagonals: Paul takes a diagonal path because all the others are blocked,
therefore this is the shortest possible path

hops: Even though the cost is 8, Paul jumps to reach the cake because it is the
only path he can take.
