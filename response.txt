Cost:
g_cost -> how many moves it takes to get from the start to that tile [g_cost.png]
h_cost -> distance from tile to the cake [h_cost.png]
f_cost -> the sum of the g_cost and the h_cost [f_cost.png]


diagonals: Paul takes a diagonal path because all the others are blocked,
therefore this is the shortest possible path. [diagonals.png]

hops: Even though the cost is 8, Paul jumps to reach the cake because it is the
only path he can take. [jumps.png]

Swamp: because there is lava in every other path, Paul want to go through the
swamp, but the cost is higher than normal [Swamp.png]
